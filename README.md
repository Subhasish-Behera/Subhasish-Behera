# 💫 About Me:
<br>Hii !🤝 I am Subhasish Behera<br>🌱 I’m interested in Ethereum Core Protocol development, Distributed Systems, Distributed Infra. <br>
Currently working on Ethereum CL Clients, PBS(Proposer-Builder-Separation), MEV, and P2P systems. I prefer to work with Rust and Go.
Always interested in privacy-preserving systems in the above areas.
